          <p>
            Flowmaster started because editing sucked. After recording hours of gameplay,
            the real work was just beginning - scrubbing through footage, trying to remember
            where the good parts were, making cut after cut after cut just to get down to
            something usable.
          </p>
          <p>
            We built Flowmaster to solve our own problem. Mark the moments to keep while
            you keep recording, let the software handle the tedious cuts later. What used
            to take hours now takes minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            We're a small team passionate about helping creators spend less time editing
            and more time creating.
