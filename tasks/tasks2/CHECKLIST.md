# Flowmaster Rebrand - Quick Reference Checklist

## Repositories
- **Website:** `C:\Users\alexb\Desktop\flowmaster-site`
- **Software:** `C:\Users\alexb\Desktop\Dev Stuff\FlowmasterSuite`

---

## Key Rules (Memorize These)

1. **"Beta" only appears after user clicks download/starts installing**
2. **Product name is "Flowmaster"** (not "Flowmaster Beta", not "Flowmaster Live")
3. **Website brand is "FLOWMASTER LIVE STUDIO"** (aspirational)
4. **Version is 0.8.5**
5. **No AI features** - creator control is the philosophy
6. **3 steps, not 4** - Mark → AutoCut → Clean Up

## Task Execution Order (Suggested)

### Phase 1: Audit
- [ ] Run Task 05 (Naming Consistency) to understand current state
- [ ] Run Task 03 (Beta Audit) on software repo

### Phase 2: Website Updates
- [ ] Task 01 - Content/copy changes
- [ ] Task 04 - Future section update
- [ ] Task 02 - Hero animation (can be done in parallel)

### Phase 3: Verification
- [ ] Cross-check both repos for consistency
- [ ] Build and test software
- [ ] Run website locally and verify all changes

## Copy Quick Reference

### Hero Tagline
> Stop scrubbing through hours of footage. Mark your best moments while you stream, and let Flowmaster cut, clean, and export your highlights.

### Download Button
> Download v0.8.5

### License Key CTA
> Get your free license key (beta)

### How It Works (3 Steps)
1. **Mark** - Hit a hotkey during epic moments. Flowmaster marks these highlights while you keep playing.
2. **AutoCut** - Run AutoCut to trim footage based on your marked timestamps. Keep the highlights, cut the rest.
3. **Clean Up** - Detect and remove original files after highlights are extracted, freeing up storage.

### Auto-Remux Feature (replaces "No Re-encoding")
> **Auto-Remux**
> Converts MKV recordings to editor-friendly MP4 while cutting—no manual remuxing required.

### Future Features (3 items)
1. **Cloud Sync & Backup** - Sync your settings and project files across devices. Never lose your work.
2. **Integrated UI with Video Preview** - A unified interface with timeline editing and real-time video preview—all in one window.
3. **Collaborative Editing** - Share projects and work together with your team through the app.

### Installer Welcome

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't** use "Flowmaster Live" - just "Flowmaster"
2. **Don't** promise "free during beta" - implies future cost
3. **Don't** add AI features to roadmap - contradicts philosophy
4. **Don't** use 4 steps in How It Works - use 3
5. **Don't** leave "No Re-encoding" - it's inaccurate
6. **Don't** show beta prominently - only in installer and key prompt parenthetical

## Success Criteria

When complete, a new user should:
1. Land on website → See "FLOWMASTER LIVE STUDIO" branding
2. Read about product → Understand it marks, cuts, and cleans footage
3. Click download → See "Download v0.8.5"
4. Get license key → See "(beta)" only in parentheses
5. Run installer → First see "Welcome to Flowmaster Beta"
6. Use application → Never see "Beta" in the running app
