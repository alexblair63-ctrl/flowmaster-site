# Flowmaster Website - Project Context

## Overview

**Domain:** flowmastersuite.com
**Framework:** Astro + Tailwind CSS
**Deployment:** GitHub Pages (later)

---

## The Product

Flowmaster solves the "pre-editing" problem: creators record 3-5 hour sessions and spend hours scrubbing through footage to find highlights. Flowmaster lets users press F9 during recording to mark moments, then automatically cuts footage to keep only the good parts.

### Three-Step System
1. **RECORD** - Press F9 during recording to mark highlight moments (Flowmaster Hotkey - Rust)
2. **AUTOCUT** - Automatically cut footage based on timestamps (AutoCut - Python)  
3. **AUTOCLEAN** - Safely delete original files after editing (AutoCleaner - Python)

### Tagline
"Edit as you record"

### Business Model
- Free during beta
- Early adopters get 50% off first year when subscription launches
- LemonSqueezy for licensing (may be replaced with custom backend)
