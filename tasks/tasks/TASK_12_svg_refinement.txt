# Task 12: SVG Animation Refinement

## Goal
Refine the placeholder SVGs based on user sketches/feedback. This task is iterative.

---

## 12.1 Process

1. **Get user sketches** - Ask user for visual reference/sketches
2. **Refine SVGs** - Update the SVG code to match vision
3. **Test animations** - Verify idle, hover, and mobile states
4. **Iterate** - Repeat until user is satisfied

## 12.2 SVG Requirements Recap

### Record Animation (Step 1 - Red #c94a4a)
- **Subject:** Finger pressing F9 key
- **Idle state:** Subtle float up/down
- **Active state:** Finger bouncing up and down on key
- **Style:** Clean, geometric, recognizable

### AutoCut Animation (Step 2 - Yellow #d4a84a)
- **Subject:** Scissors cutting through film strip
- **Idle state:** Subtle float up/down
- **Active state:** Scissors open/close while moving across film
- **Style:** Film strip with perforations, classic scissors shape

### AutoClean Animation (Step 3 - Green #4ac94a)
- **Subject:** Duster sweeping with dust clouds
- **Idle state:** Subtle float up/down
- **Active state:** Duster sways side to side, dust fades in/out
- **Style:** Feather duster, particle-like dust clouds

## 12.3 Animation Timing Guidelines

```css
/* Idle float - all SVGs */
@keyframes float {
  0%, 100% { transform: translateY(0); }
  50% { transform: translateY(-8px); }
}
.idle { animation: float 3s ease-in-out infinite; }

/* Active animations should be faster */
.active { animation-duration: 1.5s - 2s; }
```

## 12.4 Current Placeholder Locations

- `src/components/animations/RecordAnimation.astro`
- `src/components/animations/AutoCutAnimation.astro`
- `src/components/animations/AutoCleanAnimation.astro`

## 12.5 Refinement Checklist

For each SVG:

- [ ] Matches user's vision/sketch
- [ ] Uses correct step color
- [ ] Idle animation is smooth and subtle
- [ ] Active animation is engaging but not distracting
- [ ] Works at different sizes (48x48 to 200x200)
- [ ] Looks good on dark background
- [ ] Animation pauses on prefers-reduced-motion

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All 3 SVGs refined based on user feedback
- [ ] Animations feel cohesive (similar style/weight)
- [ ] User approves final versions
- [ ] SVGs are optimized (minimal code)

## Notes

This task may span multiple sessions. Start with placeholders, get feedback, iterate.

When user provides sketches:
1. Analyze the sketch for key shapes/proportions
2. Recreate in SVG code
3. Add animation keyframes
4. Test in browser
5. Get feedback, repeat
