# Timeline Animation - Feature Context

## Overview

An animated motion graphic demonstrating how Flowmaster's range-marking system works. This replaces static explanation with a visual demonstration showing the F9 key creating ranges on a moving timeline.

**Location:** Top of Features page (no section title)
**Duration:** 14 seconds, loops continuously
**Style:** Same parallax behavior as three-step section

## Core Concept

The animation shows a video timeline scrolling left (simulating recording in progress), with a playhead and the F9 key creating "keep ranges" that mark footage to save. The sequence demonstrates:

1. Basic recording (timeline moving)
2. Single F9 press creating a range
3. Multiple F9 presses over time
4. Overlapping F9 presses merging into a "smart range"

## Assets Required (5 SVG Elements)

### 1. Timeline
- Horizontal rectangular bar, dark body (#1a1a1a)
- Light tick marks at regular intervals (#404040)
- Scrolls continuously right-to-left
- Fades to transparency at left and right edges
- Scales with zoom transitions

### 2. Playhead
- Vertical line with triangle/arrow on top
- Red (#c94a4a)
- Mostly stationary (centered or at 3/4 position depending on view)
- Subtle wobble/float between views
- Represents "now" in the recording

### 3. F9 Key (3-part assembly)
- **Keycap top:** The key surface with "F9" label
- **Holster/base:** The socket the key clicks into
- **Arrow:** Downward arrow showing press action
- Animation: Arrow pushes keycap down into holster (click action, not bounce)
- Appears near playhead when triggered
- Yellow (#d4a84a) accent color

### 4. Range Bar
- Rectangular bar, yellow (#d4a84a)
- Spawns above timeline, then drops down to "ride" it
- Travels left with the timeline (attached to timeline position)
- Represents ~30 seconds of footage to keep
- Multiple ranges can exist at staggered vertical heights

### 5. Combined Range
- Longer rectangular bar, green (#4ac94a)
- Replaces multiple overlapping ranges when they merge
- Checkmark traces end-to-end after merge completes
- Shows "smart range" result

## Animation Sequence (14 seconds)

### View 0: Fade In (0-1s)
- Everything fades in from transparency
- Timeline already scrolling

### View 1: Establishing Shot (1-3s)
- **Zoom:** Close
- **Playhead:** Centered in view
- **Action:** Timeline scrolls smoothly, playhead wobbles subtly
- **Purpose:** Show recording in progress

### View 2: First Range (3-5s)
- **Zoom:** Medium (zoom out from View 1)
- **Playhead:** Moves to 3/4 - 4/5 position during zoom
- **Action:** 
  - F9 key appears and clicks down
  - Yellow range pops in above timeline
  - Range drops down to ride the timeline
  - Range begins traveling left with timeline
- **Purpose:** Show basic F9 functionality

### View 3: Second Range (5-8s)
- **Zoom:** Wide (3x out from View 2)
- **Playhead:** Stationary at new position
- **Action:**
  - First range continues traveling left
  - Another F9 press
  - Second range spawns and drops onto timeline
  - Both ranges now traveling
- **Purpose:** Show ranges are independent, saved as recording continues

### View 4: Overlapping Presses (8-11s)
- **Zoom:** Wide (same as View 3)
- **Playhead:** Stationary, subtle wobble
- **Action:**
  - 3 rapid F9 presses in succession
  - 3 ranges spawn at staggered vertical heights (not overlapping visually)
  - All 3 drop to different heights above timeline
  - Ride along for ~1.5 seconds
- **Purpose:** Show multiple rapid presses creating overlapping ranges

### View 5: Smart Merge (11-13s)
- **Zoom:** Wide (same)
- **Action:**
  - 3 yellow ranges drop down together
  - Merge/concatenate into single green combined range
  - Green checkmark traces end-to-end across combined range
- **Purpose:** Show smart range merging overlapping clips

### View 6: Fade Out (13-14s)
- Everything fades to transparency
- Loop restarts at View 0

## Technical Behavior

### Parallax
- Same mouse-following parallax as three-step section (~3% movement)
- Subtle depth effect on hover

### Responsive
- Desktop: Full animation with parallax
- Mobile: Auto-plays when scrolled into view, loops

### Reduced Motion
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion
- Show static frame or simplified version

### Looping
- Seamless loop from fade-out back to fade-in
- No pause between loops

## Implementation Notes

- This is a complex choreographed animation
- Consider using CSS keyframes with animation-delay for sequencing
- Timeline scroll is continuous (translateX animation)
- Zoom transitions use CSS scale transform
- Range positions are relative to timeline (move with it)
- F9 key can be absolutely positioned, appears on cue

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Animation plays smoothly at 60fps
- [ ] All 5 assets render correctly
- [ ] Colors match Flowmaster palette
- [ ] F9 key clicks (not bounces)
- [ ] Ranges spawn above then drop to timeline
- [ ] Ranges travel with timeline
- [ ] Merge animation shows 3 yellow → 1 green
- [ ] Checkmark traces on combined range
- [ ] 14-second loop with fade in/out
- [ ] Parallax works on desktop
- [ ] Auto-plays on mobile scroll
- [ ] Respects reduced motion preference
