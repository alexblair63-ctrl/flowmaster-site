# Task 01: Audit Current Download Flow

## Objective

Examine the existing download flow implementation to understand what needs to be modified.

## Context

The website currently has a modal/dialog that appears when users click the download button. This modal captures email before allowing the download to proceed. We need to understand the current implementation before modifying it.

## Steps

1. Locate the download button component(s) on the site
2. Find the modal/dialog component that appears on click
3. Identify how the email field is currently implemented
4. Understand how form submission triggers the download
5. Note any existing validation logic
6. Check if there's existing analytics/tracking integration
7. Document the file paths and component structure

## Deliverables

Document the following:
- File path(s) for download button component
- File path(s) for modal/dialog component
- Current form fields and validation
- How download is triggered after form submission
- Any existing analytics or data storage for email captures

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Download button component located
- [ ] Modal/dialog component located
- [ ] Email capture logic understood
- [ ] Download trigger mechanism understood
- [ ] Existing analytics integration (if any) documented
- [ ] Clear understanding of what files need modification

## Likely File Locations

- `src/pages/index.astro` or downloads page
- `src/components/` directory for modal component
- Look for terms like: Modal, Dialog, Download, Email, Form

## Notes

This is a read-only audit task. Do not modify files yet.
