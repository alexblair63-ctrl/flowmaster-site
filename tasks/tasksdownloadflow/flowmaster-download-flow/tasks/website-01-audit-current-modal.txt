# Website Task 01: Audit Current Download Modal

## Objective

Examine the existing download flow and email capture modal to understand what needs to be modified.

## Context

The flowmaster-site repository (Astro) currently has a download flow where users are prompted to enter their email before being allowed to download. This modal/dialog needs to be replaced with an attribution survey dropdown.

## Steps

1. Locate the download button(s) on the site (likely on homepage and/or dedicated downloads page)
2. Find the modal/dialog component that appears when download is clicked
3. Document the current structure:
   - What triggers the modal?
   - How is email currently captured and stored/sent?
   - What happens after email submission?
   - How does the actual download get triggered?
4. Identify all files involved in this flow
5. Note any validation logic currently in place
6. Check if attribution data is already being collected anywhere

## Deliverables

Document or comments noting:
- File paths for all relevant components
- Current modal trigger mechanism
- Email handling logic (where does it go?)
- Download trigger mechanism
- Any existing analytics or tracking

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Download modal component file(s) identified
- [ ] Email capture logic understood
- [ ] Download trigger mechanism understood
- [ ] All related files documented
- [ ] Clear picture of what needs to change

## Files to Examine

Likely locations:
- `src/pages/index.astro` (homepage)
- `src/pages/downloads.astro` or similar
- `src/components/` - look for Modal, Dialog, Download components
- Any API routes in `src/pages/api/`
