# Task 01: Audit Existing Hero and Parallax Implementation

## Objective

Before making changes, audit the current hero section structure and the existing parallax implementation on the "Easy as 1, 2, 3" section to understand what we're working with.

## Context

The Flowmaster site is built with Astro. The hero currently has:
- A centered single-column layout
- "FLOWMASTER LIVE STUDIO" tagline (to be removed)
- "Edit as you record" headline
- Description text
- CTA buttons (Download, See How It Works)
- Possibly a fade-in animation on page load

The "Easy as 1, 2, 3" section lower on the page has parallax effects on certain elements that we want to match stylistically.

## Steps

1. Locate the hero section component/page file
2. Document the current HTML structure
3. Identify any existing CSS animations or transitions
4. Find the parallax implementation for "Easy as 1, 2, 3" section
5. Note the parallax technique used (CSS, JS, scroll-based, mouse-based)
6. Document any relevant CSS variables, spacing values, or design tokens

## Deliverables

Create a brief audit document or comments noting:
- File paths for hero and parallax code
- Current animation approach (if any)
- Parallax implementation details
- Any conflicts or considerations for the new animation

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Hero section file(s) identified
- [ ] Current hero structure documented
- [ ] Existing animations identified and understood
- [ ] Parallax implementation located and analyzed
- [ ] Notes on how to match existing parallax style
- [ ] Any existing fade-in animation behavior documented

## Files to Examine

Likely locations:
- `src/pages/index.astro`
- `src/components/Hero.astro` (or similar)
- `src/styles/` directory
- Any JS files handling scroll or mouse events

## Notes

This is a read-only task. Do not modify any files yet - just gather information for subsequent tasks.
