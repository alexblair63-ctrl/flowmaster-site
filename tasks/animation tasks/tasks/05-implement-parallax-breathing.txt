# Task 05: Implement Parallax and Breathing Effects

## Objective

After the intro animation completes, add a continuous breathing/bobbing animation and mouse-tracking parallax effect to the logo (desktop only for parallax).

## Context

The logo should feel "alive" after it finishes animating in. This is achieved through:
1. A slow, continuous breathing/bobbing motion (always active)
2. Mouse position tracking that shifts the logo slightly toward the cursor (desktop only)

The entire logo moves as a unified group - individual elements don't separate.

Reference the existing parallax on the "Easy as 1, 2, 3" section for stylistic consistency (findings from Task 01).

## Specifications

### Breathing Animation
- Slow, continuous vertical bob
- Subtle scale pulse (very slight)
- Combined motion, not jarring
- CSS-based, runs indefinitely
- Active on both desktop and mobile

### Mouse Parallax (Desktop Only)
- Logo shifts toward cursor position
- Maximum drift: ~20px in any direction
- Smooth easing on movement (not 1:1 instant tracking)
- Applied to the entire logo group wrapper
- Should feel cohesive with existing site parallax

## Steps

1. Create `src/scripts/logo-parallax.js`
2. Add breathing keyframe animation to CSS
3. Implement mouse move listener for parallax
4. Apply parallax transform to logo wrapper
5. Ensure breathing and parallax combine smoothly
6. Disable mouse parallax on mobile/touch devices
7. Start effects only after intro animation completes (~2.25s delay)

## CSS - Breathing Animation

```css
@keyframes breathe {
  0%, 100% {
    transform: translateY(0) scale(1);
  }
  50% {
    transform: translateY(-8px) scale(1.02);
  }
}

.logo-parallax-wrapper.animation-complete {
  animation: breathe 4s ease-in-out infinite;
}
```

## JavaScript - Mouse Parallax

```javascript
// logo-parallax.js

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  const logoWrapper = document.querySelector('.logo-parallax-wrapper');
  if (!logoWrapper) return;

  const maxDrift = 20; // pixels
  const easing = 0.08; // smoothing factor
  
  let targetX = 0;
  let targetY = 0;
  let currentX = 0;
  let currentY = 0;
  let animationStarted = false;

  // Wait for intro animation to complete
  setTimeout(() => {
    logoWrapper.classList.add('animation-complete');
    animationStarted = true;
  }, 2250);

  // Only on non-touch devices
  if (window.matchMedia('(hover: hover)').matches) {
    document.addEventListener('mousemove', (e) => {
      if (!animationStarted) return;
      
      const centerX = window.innerWidth / 2;
      const centerY = window.innerHeight / 2;
      
      // Calculate offset from center (-1 to 1)
      const offsetX = (e.clientX - centerX) / centerX;
      const offsetY = (e.clientY - centerY) / centerY;
      
      targetX = offsetX * maxDrift;
      targetY = offsetY * maxDrift;
    });

    function animate() {
      currentX += (targetX - currentX) * easing;
      currentY += (targetY - currentY) * easing;
      
      logoWrapper.style.setProperty('--parallax-x', `${currentX}px`);
      logoWrapper.style.setProperty('--parallax-y', `${currentY}px`);
      
      requestAnimationFrame(animate);
    }
    
    animate();
  }
});
```

```css
.logo-parallax-wrapper {
  transform: translate(var(--parallax-x, 0), var(--parallax-y, 0));
  transition: transform 0.1s ease-out;
}

/* Combine with breathing when both active */
.logo-parallax-wrapper.animation-complete {
  animation: breathe 4s ease-in-out infinite;
  transform: translate(var(--parallax-x, 0), var(--parallax-y, 0));
}
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Breathing animation activates after intro animation completes
- [ ] Breathing motion is slow and subtle (not distracting)
- [ ] Mouse parallax works on desktop, shifting logo toward cursor
- [ ] Maximum parallax drift is approximately 20px
- [ ] Parallax movement is smooth/eased, not jittery
- [ ] Parallax is disabled on touch/mobile devices
- [ ] Breathing continues on mobile (parallax just disabled)
- [ ] Logo moves as unified group (elements don't separate)
- [ ] Effects run indefinitely while hero is visible
- [ ] Performance is smooth (no dropped frames)
- [ ] Parallax style is consistent with existing "Easy as 1,2,3" section

## Testing

- Move mouse around screen, verify logo responds smoothly
- Check that logo doesn't drift too far from its position
- Test on mobile device or emulator - breathing works, no parallax
- Verify no layout shift or jank
- Confirm breathing and parallax combine without conflict
