# Task 07: Integration Testing and Polish

## Objective

Final testing, bug fixes, and polish to ensure the animation and layout work correctly across all scenarios.

## Context

All features have been implemented. This task focuses on:
- Cross-browser testing
- Performance optimization
- Edge case handling
- Visual polish and timing adjustments
- Code cleanup

## Testing Checklist

### Animation
- [ ] Intro animation plays on initial page load
- [ ] Animation does not replay when scrolling away and back
- [ ] Animation does not replay when navigating back to page (browser back button)
- [ ] Timing feels natural - not too fast, not too slow
- [ ] No "flash of unstyled content" before animation starts
- [ ] Elements reach correct final positions
- [ ] Smooth easing throughout (no jerky motion)

### Parallax & Breathing
- [ ] Breathing starts after intro completes (~2.25s)
- [ ] Breathing is subtle and not distracting
- [ ] Mouse parallax responds smoothly on desktop
- [ ] Parallax drift stays within ~20px bounds
- [ ] Logo stays aligned with page content (doesn't drift out of hero)
- [ ] No parallax on touch devices
- [ ] Breathing works on mobile

### Layout
- [ ] Desktop two-column layout displays correctly
- [ ] Mobile stacked layout displays correctly
- [ ] Transition between breakpoints is smooth
- [ ] No layout shift during or after animation
- [ ] Logo is properly sized on all viewports
- [ ] Text alignment correct (left on desktop, center on mobile)
- [ ] "FLOWMASTER LIVE STUDIO" tagline removed from hero

### Cross-Browser
- [ ] Chrome (latest)
- [ ] Firefox (latest)
- [ ] Safari (latest)
- [ ] Edge (latest)
- [ ] Mobile Safari (iOS)
- [ ] Chrome Mobile (Android)

### Performance
- [ ] Animation runs at 60fps (no dropped frames)
- [ ] No excessive CPU usage during idle breathing
- [ ] No memory leaks from parallax event listeners
- [ ] Page load time not significantly impacted

### Accessibility
- [ ] Animation respects `prefers-reduced-motion` media query
- [ ] Content is still visible/accessible if CSS animations fail
- [ ] No seizure-inducing rapid flashing

## Reduced Motion Support

Add support for users who prefer reduced motion:

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .logo-square,
  .logo-text-flowmaster,
  .logo-text-livestudio {
    animation: none;
    opacity: 1;
    transform: none;
  }
  
  .logo-parallax-wrapper {
    animation: none;
  }
}
```

```javascript
// In logo-parallax.js
if (window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)').matches) {
  // Skip all animations, show logo immediately
  logoWrapper.classList.add('animation-complete');
  return;
}
```

## Polish Items

- Fine-tune animation timing if needed
- Adjust breathing speed/amplitude if too subtle or too much
- Tweak parallax easing for best feel
- Ensure logo sizing looks good at all viewport sizes
- Clean up any unused CSS or commented code
- Add code comments for maintainability

## Bug Fixes

Document and fix any issues found during testing:

1. Issue: _______________
   Fix: _______________

2. Issue: _______________
   Fix: _______________

## Final Verification

- [ ] Fresh page load shows complete animation sequence
- [ ] Logo settles into correct position
- [ ] Breathing and parallax activate smoothly
- [ ] Mobile layout correct
- [ ] Desktop layout correct
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Code is clean and commented
- [ ] All acceptance criteria from previous tasks still pass

## Deployment Notes

- Ensure all new CSS/JS files are properly imported
- Verify build process includes new assets
- Test production build, not just dev server
- Clear any CDN cache if applicable
