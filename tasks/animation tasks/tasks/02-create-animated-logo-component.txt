# Task 02: Create Animated Logo Component

## Objective

Create a new Astro component that contains the logo SVG elements structured for animation.

## Context

The logo consists of 5 animatable parts:
1. Red square (leftmost)
2. Yellow square (center)
3. Green square (rightmost)
4. "Flowmaster" text (below squares)
5. "LIVE STUDIO" text (bottom, smaller, letter-spaced)

The squares are horizontally aligned and equidistant. Reference `LogoAssets/Logos/LogoHorizontalLockup.svg` for the final composed layout.

## Steps

1. Create `src/components/AnimatedLogo.astro`
2. Inline the SVG elements (not as external references) for animation control
3. Structure with appropriate class names for each animatable element
4. Wrap all elements in a container for unified parallax movement post-animation
5. Set initial states (opacity: 0, transforms for starting positions)

## SVG Assets to Use

From `LogoAssets/Logos/`:
- `RedBox.svg`
- `YellowBox.svg`
- `GreenBox.svg`
- `FlowmasterType.svg`
- `LiveStudioType.svg`

Or extract the relevant paths from `LogoHorizontalLockup.svg` which contains all elements properly positioned.

## Component Structure

```astro
---
// AnimatedLogo.astro
---

<div class="logo-animation-container">
  <div class="logo-parallax-wrapper">
    <div class="logo-squares">
      <svg class="logo-square logo-red">...</svg>
      <svg class="logo-square logo-yellow">...</svg>
      <svg class="logo-square logo-green">...</svg>
    </div>
    <svg class="logo-text-flowmaster">...</svg>
    <svg class="logo-text-livestudio">...</svg>
  </div>
</div>

<style>
  /* Initial hidden states */
  .logo-square,
  .logo-text-flowmaster,
  .logo-text-livestudio {
    opacity: 0;
  }
</style>
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Component file created at `src/components/AnimatedLogo.astro`
- [ ] All 5 logo elements are present and properly structured
- [ ] SVG code is inlined (not external references)
- [ ] Each element has a distinct class for animation targeting
- [ ] Elements are visually positioned to match final logo composition
- [ ] Initial state has all elements hidden (opacity: 0)
- [ ] Wrapper div exists for unified parallax movement
- [ ] Component renders without errors when imported

## Notes

- Use the full SVG path data from the source files
- Maintain the exact proportions and spacing from the original logo
- The squares should be ~equal size and horizontally aligned with even gaps
- Consider using CSS custom properties for sizing to aid responsiveness
