================================================================================
PROJECT OVERVIEW
================================================================================

You are building a marketing website for Flowmaster Suite, a video editing 
automation toolkit for content creators who record long gaming/streaming sessions.

The product solves the "pre-editing" problem: creators record 3-5 hour sessions
and spend hours scrubbing through footage to find highlights. Flowmaster lets
users press F9 during recording to mark moments, then automatically cuts footage
to keep only the good parts.

THREE-STEP SYSTEM:
1. RECORD - Press F9 during recording to mark highlight moments (Flowmaster Hotkey)
2. AUTOCUT - Automatically cut footage based on timestamps (AutoCut)
3. AUTOCLEAN - Safely delete original files after editing (AutoCleaner)

TAGLINE: "Edit as you record"

BUSINESS MODEL: Free beta, then subscription. Early adopters get 50% off first year.

FRAMEWORK: Astro (already initialized in ~/Desktop/flowmaster-site)
STYLING: Tailwind CSS (add via: npx astro add tailwind)
ANIMATIONS: CSS + vanilla JavaScript (no heavy libraries)
DEPLOYMENT: GitHub Pages (later)

INSTALL DEPENDENCIES:
- npx astro add tailwind

================================================================================
DESIGN SYSTEM
================================================================================

COLOR PALETTE:
--color-bg-primary: #0a0a0a (near black, main background)
--color-bg-secondary: #141414 (slightly lighter, cards/sections)
--color-bg-tertiary: #1a1a1a (hover states, borders)

--color-red: #c94a4a (Flowmaster brand red, from logo)
--color-red-bright: #e05555 (hover/accent states)

--color-white: #ffffff
--color-gray-100: #f5f5f5
--color-gray-300: #d4d4d4
--color-gray-500: #737373
--color-gray-700: #404040

--color-alenzie-mint: #55ffa2 (ONLY used for Alenzie footer link)

STEP COLORS (for 1-2-3 animation section):
--color-step-1: #c94a4a (red - Record)
--color-step-2: #d4a84a (yellow/gold - AutoCut)  
--color-step-3: #4ac94a (green - AutoClean)

TYPOGRAPHY:
- Headings: Inter or Space Grotesk (techy but professional)
- Body: Inter
- Weights: 400 (body), 500 (emphasis), 600 (subheadings), 700 (headings)

FONT LOADING (add to BaseLayout):
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;500;600;700&family=Space+Grotesk:wght@500;600;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

SPACING SCALE (Tailwind defaults are fine):
- Section padding: py-20 or py-24
- Container max-width: max-w-6xl mx-auto px-6

BACKGROUND TEXTURE:
Apply a subtle carbon fiber pattern to the body background.
CSS approach:
```css
body {
  background-color: #0a0a0a;
  background-image: 
    linear-gradient(45deg, #0d0d0d 25%, transparent 25%),
    linear-gradient(-45deg, #0d0d0d 25%, transparent 25%),
    linear-gradient(45deg, transparent 75%, #0d0d0d 75%),
    linear-gradient(-45deg, transparent 75%, #0d0d0d 75%);
  background-size: 4px 4px;
  background-position: 0 0, 0 2px, 2px -2px, -2px 0px;
}
```
This should be VERY subtle - barely noticeable, just adds depth.

================================================================================
NAVIGATION BEHAVIOR
================================================================================

The navbar should be INVISIBLE when user first loads the page.
As user scrolls down (past the hero section), navbar fades in and becomes fixed.

NAVBAR STRUCTURE:
- Logo (left) - links to home
- Nav links (center): Features, Future, About, Docs
- Download button (right) - styled as primary CTA button

IMPLEMENTATION:
```javascript
// In Header.astro or separate script
const nav = document.querySelector('nav');
const hero = document.querySelector('#hero');

const observer = new IntersectionObserver(
  ([entry]) => {
    if (entry.isIntersecting) {
      nav.classList.add('opacity-0', 'pointer-events-none');
      nav.classList.remove('opacity-100');
    } else {
      nav.classList.remove('opacity-0', 'pointer-events-none');
      nav.classList.add('opacity-100');
    }
  },
  { threshold: 0.1 }
);

observer.observe(hero);
```

Nav styling when visible:
- Background: bg-black/80 backdrop-blur-md
- Fixed position: fixed top-0 left-0 right-0 z-50
- Transition: transition-opacity duration-300

================================================================================
PAGE: HOME (index.astro)
================================================================================

SECTION 1: HERO
---------------
Style reference: alenzie.com - minimal, focused, plenty of whitespace (darkspace)

Layout:
- Full viewport height (min-h-screen)
- Centered content
- Logo at top (small, subtle)
- Main heading: "Flowmaster Live Studio"
- Subheading/tagline: "Edit as you record"
- Brief one-liner: "Stop scrubbing through hours of footage. Mark your highlights live, cut automatically."
- Primary CTA button: "Download Beta" → links to /download
- Small text below button: "Free during beta • Windows 10/11"

Visual treatment:
- Dark background with subtle carbon texture
- Logo with slight glow/ambient effect
- Text appears with subtle fade-in on load (0.5s delay, 0.8s duration)
- Minimal - no clutter, no extra graphics in this section

SECTION 2: THREE-STEP ANIMATION
-------------------------------
This is the signature visual section. Three horizontal columns showing the workflow.

Container:
- Optional small title above: "How it works" or just let the visuals speak
- Three equal columns on desktop, stack vertically on mobile
- Each column has:
  - Step number (1, 2, 3) in respective color
  - Step name (Record, AutoCut, AutoClean)
  - Animated SVG illustration
  - Brief description (1 sentence)

STEP 1 - RECORD (Red #c94a4a):
- Illustration: Finger pressing down on F9 key
- Animation: Finger bounces up and down on key (idle: slight float, hover: active pressing)
- Description: "Press F9 to mark highlight moments while you play"

STEP 2 - AUTOCUT (Yellow #d4a84a):
- Illustration: Scissors cutting through film strip
- Animation: Scissors open/close as they move through film (idle: slight float, hover: cutting motion)
- Description: "Automatically trim footage to just the good parts"

STEP 3 - AUTOCLEAN (Green #4ac94a):
- Illustration: Duster sweeping with dust clouds
- Animation: Duster sways side to side, dust particles fade in/out (idle: slight float, hover: active sweeping)
- Description: "Safely clean up original files and free storage"

ANIMATION BEHAVIOR:
- Desktop: Elements have subtle idle float (translateY ±3px, 3s ease-in-out infinite)
- Desktop: On hover (within ~50px proximity), animation activates to full loop
- Mobile: Animations auto-play when scrolled into view, loop 2-3 times, then return to idle
- Parallax: These elements respond to mouse position (desktop only), moving ~3% relative to cursor
- Stagger: When section scrolls into view, columns animate in one by one (1... 2... 3...) with 0.3s delays

SVG NOTES:
For initial development, create simple placeholder SVGs that capture the concept.
Use geometric shapes and clear silhouettes. These can be refined later.
The user will provide sketches for the final versions - for now, make them functional.

SECTION 3: HOW IT WORKS
-----------------------
More detailed explanation of the workflow. Can use icons or simple graphics.

Content:
1. "Record your session" - Open OBS, hit record, play your game
2. "Mark the moments" - Press F9 whenever something highlight-worthy happens
3. "Run AutoCut" - One click to trim your footage to just the marked segments
4. "Clean up" - Delete massive original files, keep just the edited versions

Format: Could be a vertical timeline, numbered steps, or icon grid.
Keep it clean and scannable.

SECTION 4: FEATURES PREVIEW
---------------------------
Quick feature highlights that link to the full Features page.

Feature cards (3-4):
- "Works with OBS" - Integrates seamlessly with your existing setup
- "No re-encoding" - Stream copy means instant exports, no quality loss
- "Webcam sync" - Automatically matches your webcam footage too
- "Recycle bin safe" - Deleted files go to recycle bin, always recoverable

CTA: "See all features →" links to /features

SECTION 5: FUTURE FEATURES (Preview)
------------------------------------
Teaser for the "What we're building" section.

Show the mockup interface image (the Photoshop prototype with red/yellow/green tabs).
Position it as an exciting preview of what's coming.

Layout: Image on one side, bullet points on other:
- "Unified interface for seamless workflow"
- "AI assistant tools for smart editing"
- "Direct export to Premiere, DaVinci, CapCut"

CTA: "See our roadmap →" links to /future

SECTION 6: TESTIMONIALS
-----------------------
5 testimonial cards in a horizontal swipeable carousel.

For now, use placeholder content:
- Placeholder avatar (gray circle with initials)
- Placeholder name and title (e.g., "Gaming Creator")
- Placeholder quote about how Flowmaster saved them time

Featured video testimonial:
- Prominent placement (could be above or integrated with carousel)
- Placeholder video thumbnail with play button
- Text: "See how [Name] uses Flowmaster" (placeholder)

Carousel behavior:
- Swipeable on mobile (touch)
- Arrow buttons on desktop
- Dots indicator below
- Auto-advance optional (probably not, let user control)

SECTION 7: FINAL CTA
--------------------
Strong call to action section before footer.

hours now takes minutes.

We're a small team passionate about helping creators spend less time editing

================================================================================
ANIMATION SPECIFICATIONS
================================================================================

GENERAL PRINCIPLES:
- Animations should feel polished but not overwhelming
- Performance is key - use CSS transforms and opacity, avoid layout thrash
- Respect reduced-motion preferences: @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)

ENTRANCE ANIMATIONS:
Elements animate in as they scroll into view.
- Use Intersection Observer API
- Fade + slight translateY (20px → 0)
- Duration: 0.6s, easing: ease-out
- Stagger multiple elements by 0.1s each

HERO ENTRANCE:
- Logo fades in first (0.3s delay)
- Heading fades in (0.5s delay)
- Tagline fades in (0.7s delay)
- CTA button fades in (0.9s delay)

THREE-STEP SECTION:
- Columns stagger in: first at 0s, second at 0.3s, third at 0.6s
- Each column: fade + translateY

SVG IDLE ANIMATION (all three):
```css
@keyframes float {
  0%, 100% { transform: translateY(0); }
  50% { transform: translateY(-6px); }
}
.svg-idle {
  animation: float 3s ease-in-out infinite;
}
```

SVG HOVER ACTIVATION:
On hover (or when in proximity on desktop), add class that triggers active animation.
Each SVG has its own active animation keyframes.

PARALLAX EFFECT:
Desktop only. Track mouse position, apply subtle transform to SVG containers.
```javascript
document.addEventListener('mousemove', (e) => {
  const x = (e.clientX / window.innerWidth - 0.5) * 2; // -1 to 1
  const y = (e.clientY / window.innerHeight - 0.5) * 2;
  
  document.querySelectorAll('.parallax-element').forEach(el => {
    const depth = el.dataset.depth || 0.03;
    const moveX = x * depth * 100;
    const moveY = y * depth * 100;
    el.style.transform = `translate(${moveX}px, ${moveY}px)`;
  });
});
```

MOBILE SCROLL-TRIGGERED:
```javascript
const observer = new IntersectionObserver(
  (entries) => {
    entries.forEach(entry => {
      if (entry.isIntersecting) {
        entry.target.classList.add('animate-active');
        // Remove after a few loops
        setTimeout(() => {
          entry.target.classList.remove('animate-active');
        }, 6000); // 2-3 loops at ~2s each
      }
    });
  },
  { threshold: 0.5 }
);
```

================================================================================
SVG PLACEHOLDER SPECIFICATIONS
================================================================================

These are starter SVGs. User will provide sketches for refinement later.

RECORD ANIMATION (Finger + F9 Key):
- Viewbox: 0 0 200 200
- Key: Rounded rectangle, dark gray with "F9" text
- Finger: Simple hand silhouette pointing down

================================================================================
NOTES FOR CLAUDE CODE
================================================================================

1. Start with Phase 1 and 2 to get a working homepage quickly.

2. For SVG animations, create simple functional placeholders first. The user 
   will provide sketches later for refinement. Don't spend too long making 
   them perfect initially.

3. The email capture on /download can initially just be a form that doesn't 
   submit anywhere (or use Formspree for quick implementation). The user will 
   integrate a proper backend later.

4. All placeholder content should be clearly marked with comments so it's 
   easy to find and replace later.

5. Prioritize getting the visual feel right - dark, techy, professional, 
   with pops of color in the three-step section.

6. The parallax and hover animations are important for the "wow factor" but 
   should be subtle (3% movement range). Don't make it feel like a video game.

7. Test the navbar fade behavior early - this is a key part of the UX.

8. For icons, Lucide (lucide.dev) is a good lightweight option that works 
   well with Astro/Tailwind.
